Day-4:Fun with callback functions


Functions do not need to be named, or even assigned to a variable. These are known as anonymous functions.
Anonymous functions are often declared while being passed in as callbacks to other functions. Why? Because the receiving function that takes in the anonymous function will give that parameter a name anyway.

Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.
This includes, but is not limited to, functions which take in functions (callbacks) as arguments.

This means that built-in functions such as forEach, filter, and others can be called "Higher-Order Functions".
